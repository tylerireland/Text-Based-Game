# Text-Based Game

## Description
This unnamed text-based game is a small singleplayer turn based game. The player is walking through the woods and many monsters come to attack. Your goal is to fend off as many monsters as possible. There is a lot of small things that I added to this game over time. I included leveling up, a tracker for enemies defeated, bosses, power-ups, and much more. It is a very simple game but there are a lot of different factors that changes the gameplay over time. Each level up makes the player and enemies stronger, and as you level up, you gain access to Magic. Enemies also drop a radnom number of loot items and there are many mulipliers that will change how much xp and loot is dropped. There is much more that I could add to this game. A long term goal of this project is to add graphics.
